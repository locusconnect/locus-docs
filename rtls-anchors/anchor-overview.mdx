# Locus Anchor Overview

Locus Anchors are the foundational fixed reference points for any Locus Real-Time Location System (RTLS) deployment. They are strategically installed throughout your facility to enable precise and reliable positioning of mobile Locus Tags.

## What is a Locus Anchor?

A Locus Anchor is a stationary device mounted at known positions within your deployment area. Each anchor communicates with mobile tags and other anchors using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology. This technology allows for precise distance measurements (ranging) between devices, achieving centimeter-level accuracy for location calculations.
