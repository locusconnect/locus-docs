# Device Care

## Overview

Proper care and maintenance of your Locus RTLS devices ensures optimal performance, accuracy, and longevity. This guide covers essential care instructions for both anchors and tags.

## Anchor Maintenance

### Physical Care
- Mount securely using provided brackets
- Avoid exposure to direct sunlight and extreme temperatures
- Keep ventilation holes unobstructed
- Clean monthly using dry, non-abrasive cloth
- Check mounting hardware quarterly for tightness

### Environmental Considerations
- Operating temperature: 0째C to 50째C (32째F to 122째F)
- Humidity: 10% to 90% non-condensing
- IP54 rated - protected against dust and water splashes
- Avoid installation near large metal objects or strong RF sources

### Power Management
- Use only approved power supplies
- Check power connections monthly
- Ensure stable power source with proper grounding
- Consider UPS backup for critical installations
- Monitor power consumption for anomalies

### Network Connectivity
- Check network cables for damage
- Secure all network connections
- Monitor signal strength regularly
- Keep firmware updated
- Document IP addresses and network settings

## Tag Care

### Battery Management
- Monitor battery levels through dashboard
- Replace batteries when indicated (typically 15-20% remaining)
- Use only recommended battery types
- Store spare batteries properly
- Document battery replacement dates

### Physical Handling
- Avoid dropping or impact
- Keep water resistant seals intact
- Clean with slightly damp cloth only
- Store in dry environment when not in use
- Check attachment points regularly

### Usage Guidelines
