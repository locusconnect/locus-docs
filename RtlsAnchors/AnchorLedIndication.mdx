# Anchor LED Indication

## LED Overview

Locus RTLS Anchors feature multiple status LEDs that provide visual feedback on the anchor's operational state. Understanding these indicators helps with installation, troubleshooting, and maintenance.

## LED Locations

The Locus Anchor has the following LED indicators:

* **Power LED** (Green) - Top right of the unit
* **Network LED** (Amber) - Adjacent to Ethernet port
* **Status LED** (Multi-color) - Front center of the unit
* **Activity LED** (Blue) - Front lower section of the unit

## LED Status Patterns

### Power LED

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Solid Green | Power is on and within normal operating range |
| Off | No power is supplied to the anchor |
| Blinking Green | Power-on self-test in progress |

### Network LED

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Solid Amber | Active network connection established |
| Blinking Amber | Network traffic activity |
| Off | No network connection |
| Rapid Blink | Network error condition |

### Status LED

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Solid Green | Anchor operating normally |
| Solid Red | Error condition detected |
| Blinking Green | Anchor is in setup/configuration mode |
| Blinking Red | Hardware fault detected |
| Alternating Red/Green | Firmware update in progress |
| Off | Anchor is not operational |

### Activity LED

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Blinking Blue | UWB radio activity (tag detection) |
| Off | No UWB activity detected |
| Rapid Blinking Blue | High volume of tag traffic |

## LED Sequences During Boot

When an anchor is powered on, it goes through the following LED sequence:

1. All LEDs illuminate briefly for self-test
2. Power LED turns solid green
3. Status LED blinks green during initialization
4. Network LED turns on when network connection is established
5. Status LED turns solid green when anchor is operational
6. Activity LED blinks when UWB radio activity is detected

## Troubleshooting With LEDs

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| No LEDs on | No power to anchor | Check PoE connection and power source |
| Status LED red | Anchor error condition | Restart anchor, check in RTLS Hub |
| Network LED off | Network connection issue | Check cable and network equipment |
| Status LED blinking red | Hardware fault | Contact support for assistance |
| All LEDs blinking together | Anchor in recovery mode | Use RTLS Hub to restore firmware |

## LED Configuration

LED behavior can be configured in the RTLS Hub software:

* Activity LED intensity (High/Medium/Low/Off)
* Status LED enable/disable
* Custom LED patterns for specific deployments
