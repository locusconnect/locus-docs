# Line of Sight (LOS)

## Overview

Line of Sight (LOS) parameters are fundamental metrics in Locus RTLS that characterize signal propagation paths between system components. These parameters are crucial for determining measurement quality, optimizing system performance, and ensuring reliable positioning.

## Signal Propagation

### Path Types
```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef los fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#2E7D32,stroke-width:2px,color:white
    classDef nlos fill:#F44336,stroke:#D32F2F,stroke-width:2px,color:white
    classDef device fill:#1976D2,stroke:#0D47A1,stroke-width:2px,color:white

    A[Transmitter] --> B[Direct Path]
    A --> C[Reflected Path]
    A --> D[Diffracted Path]
    
    B --> E[Receiver]
    C --> E
    D --> E

    class A,E device
    class B los
    class C,D nlos
```

### Signal Characteristics
| Path Type | Delay | Power | Reliability |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Direct | Minimal | Strongest | Highest |
| Reflected | Variable | Attenuated | Medium |
| Diffracted | Extended | Weak | Low |
| Scattered | Random | Very weak | Unreliable |

    classDef result fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#2E7D32,stroke-width:2px,color:white

    A[UWB Signal] --> B[Channel Response]
    B --> C[First Path]
    B --> D[Multipath]

    C --> F[Path Analysis]
    D --> F
    E --> F

    class A signal

### Quality Metrics
| Parameter | LOS | NLOS | Impact |
|-----------|-----|------|---------|
| First Path Power | Greater than \-85 dBm | Less than \-85 dBm | Critical |
| Path Loss | Less than \-20 dB/m | Greater than \-20 dB/m | High |
| Delay Spread | Less than 20 ns | Greater than 20 ns | Medium |
| SNR | Greater than 10 dB | Less than 10 dB | High |
