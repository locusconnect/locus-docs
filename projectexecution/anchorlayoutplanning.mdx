title: Anchor Layout Planning
---

The Locus [RF Planner](/RtlsRfPlanner/Overview) is a free tool available to all the partners in the Locus portal once you create a new project. With the help of this tool you can simulate a real world walls and columns, and then after placing anchors (virtual) you can check the coverage of the signal.

## Video guide for making a good layout in locus RF Planner

## Anchor layout prior to Site Survey
You may ask a floorpan from the customer even before visiting the customer site and do a rough anchor layout draft to show the customer how anchor deployment could look like. At this moment the draft is done assuming no obstacles (because you will only get environment information after performing site survey). 

## Anchor layout after Site Survey
After performing site survey and getting enough information about environment, you can go ahead and input all information on the RF Planner. Obstacle can be drawn in any shape and size using mouse cursor. 

## Updating RF planner with macro-details
Every obstacle like wall, pillars, big machineries, etc. must be drawn into the RF Planner with good enough measurements. Correct Anchor coordinates (x,y) and obstacles allows you to calculate coverage in the are using DOP (Dilution of Precision) functionality of the RF Planner. More details on adding obstacles can be found in [Usage Guide](/RtlsRfPlanner/UsageGuide)

## Final check before Approval

The final layout of anchors in the RF Planner should have 
	- Set of Anchors with defined heights
	- Macro-obstacles and walls
	- Described project use-case in the project page
