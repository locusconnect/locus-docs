# Network Architecture

The RTLS system requires specific network configurations to ensure optimal performance and security. Below is the recommended network architecture:

![Network Diagram Example](/assets/photos/NetworkDiagramExample.svg)

## Network Components
- RTLS Hub Server
- Anchor Network
- Client Network
- Management Network
- External Services

## Ports List
All ports listed are TCP unless otherwise specified:

|**Port Number**|**Port Description**|**Data Flow**|
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
|80|HTTP|Inbound - Web Interface|
|443|HTTPS|Inbound - Secure Web Interface|
|8080|RTLS Hub Service|Inbound - Anchor Communication|
|8443|RTLS Hub Secure Service|Inbound - Secure Anchor Communication|
|5432|PostgreSQL|Internal - Database Communication|
|1883|MQTT|Internal - Message Broker|
|8883|MQTT over TLS|Internal - Secure Message Broker|

## Network Requirements

### Bandwidth
- Minimum 100 Mbps for anchor network
- Gigabit recommended for server network
- Low latency (<50ms) between components

### VLAN Configuration
1. **Management VLAN**
   - RTLS Hub management
   - System administration
   - Monitoring tools

2. **Anchor VLAN**
   - Dedicated for anchors
   - Isolated from general traffic
   - QoS priority

3. **Client VLAN**
   - User access
   - Web interface
   - API connections

### Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Implement proper network segmentation and firewall rules to protect the RTLS system.
</Callout>

#### Recommended Rules
- Restrict management access
- Implement port security
- Enable HTTPS only
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Regular security audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connectivity Problems**
   - Check physical connections
   - Verify VLAN configurations
   - Test port accessibility
   - Review firewall rules

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor bandwidth usage
   - Check for network congestion
   - Verify QoS settings
   - Analyze latency metrics

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Always consult your network administrator before making changes to network configuration.
