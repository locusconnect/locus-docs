If you plan to store past data in the database or use our WISE Analytics software, it is recommended to have an available hard drive on the server (preferably SSD). The required size of the drive depends on the amount and age of data that you want to retain. Each discrete tag location payload occupies 120 bytes of space, which can be used to estimate the necessary disk space for your specific application. To calculate an estimation, use the following formula - <br/>

<img src="https://math.vercel.app?bgcolor=auto&from=\left(\color{purple}\textbf{Total}\space\textbf{ no.}\space \textbf{of}\space \textbf{Tags} \color{Black} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\textbf{1}}{\color{blue} \textbf{Refresh} \space \textbf{Rate[s]}} \right) \cdot \left( \color{purple}\textbf{ Total}\space \textbf{Operational} \space \textbf{Time[s]} \color{black} \right) \cdot \left( \color{purple} \textbf{120} \space \left[ \textbf{Bytes}\right] \color{black} \right)" />

Example: with 2 tags and a refresh interval of 100 ms, each payload containing 120 Bytes, the system will generate a database size of 8.64 MB per hour or 207.36 MB per day. With a 1 TB disk, you'll be able to store historic data for approximately 4822 days.

However, this consider just location data itself. The database also stores battery information, device logs etc., which means that the true capacity will be lower. Reserve at least 10% of the disc space for this additional overhead.
