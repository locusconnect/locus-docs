## Physical Deployment Process

After completing the floor plan and layout planning, follow these steps for physical anchor deployment:

1. **Site Preparation**
   - Verify mounting locations
   - Check power availability
   - Confirm network access
   - Review safety requirements

2. **Equipment Setup**
   - Leica Total Station
   - Mounting hardware
   - Network cables
   - Power supplies
   - Safety equipment

## Using Leica Total Station

### Initial Setup
1. Position the Total Station at a known reference point
2. Level and calibrate the instrument
3. Set up the reference coordinates
4. Verify line of sight to anchor locations

### Coordinate Calculation
1. Target each anchor location
2. Record horizontal and vertical angles
3. Measure distances
4. Calculate X, Y, Z coordinates
5. Document measurements

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Accurate coordinate measurement is crucial for system performance. Double-check all measurements before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Coordinate Documentation

### Required Information
- Anchor ID
- X, Y, Z coordinates
- Reference points
- Installation height
- Orientation details

### Data Format
```json
{
  "anchor_id": "string",
  "coordinates": {
    "x": "float",
    "y": "float",
    "z": "float"
  },
  "reference_point": "string",
  "installation_height": "float",
  "orientation": "degrees"
}
```

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Steps
1. Re-measure key points
2. Cross-reference with plan
3. Verify anchor orientation
4. Test network connectivity
5. Document final position

### Documentation
- As-built drawings
- Coordinate sheets
- Installation photos
- Network details
