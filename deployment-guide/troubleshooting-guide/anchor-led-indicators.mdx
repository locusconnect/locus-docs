## LED Indicator Overview

Locus RTLS anchors use LED indicators to communicate their status and operation mode. Understanding these indicators is crucial for system maintenance and troubleshooting.

## LED Colors and Patterns

| LED Color | Pattern | Status | Action Required |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Blue | Solid | Power On | None - Normal operation |
| Blue | Blinking | Startup/Boot | Wait for completion |
| Green | Solid | Connected | None - Normal operation |
| Green | Blinking | Data Transfer | None - Active communication |
| Red | Solid | Error | Check error logs |
| Red | Blinking | Configuration Mode | None if intentional |
| Off | - | No Power | Check power connection |

## Status Sequences

### Normal Startup Sequence
1. Blue blinking (Boot)
