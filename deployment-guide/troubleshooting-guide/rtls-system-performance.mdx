## Performance Metrics

The RTLS system performance can be monitored through several key metrics:

| Metric | Description | Optimal Range |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Update Rate | Frequency of position updates | As configured (typically 100ms-1000ms) |
| Position Accuracy | Deviation from actual position | ±30cm in optimal conditions |
| Tag Battery Life | Duration of tag operation | As per configuration (see [Tag Settings](/projectexecution/tagconfigurationrules/tagsettings)) |
| Network Latency | Delay in data transmission | &lt;50ms recommended |

## Monitoring Tools

### System Dashboard
The RTLS Hub provides a real-time dashboard showing:
- Active tag count
- Active anchor count
- System uptime
- Network status
- Position update statistics

### Performance Alerts
Configure alerts for:
- Tag battery levels
- Anchor connectivity issues
- Network performance degradation
- System resource utilization

## Optimization Guidelines

1. **Network Performance**
   - Ensure proper network segmentation
   - Monitor bandwidth utilization
   - Keep firmware up to date

2. **Position Accuracy**
   - Maintain clear line of sight between tags and anchors
   - Regular calibration checks
   - Proper anchor placement verification

3. **System Resources**
   - Monitor CPU usage
   - Check memory utilization
   - Verify storage capacity

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Position Jumps | Signal interference | Check for metal objects or interference sources |
| Delayed Updates | Network congestion | Verify network capacity and configuration |
| Poor Accuracy | Improper anchor placement | Review anchor deployment guidelines |
| System Lag | Resource constraints | Check server specifications compliance |
