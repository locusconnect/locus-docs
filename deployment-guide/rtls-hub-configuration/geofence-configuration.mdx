## Understanding Geofencing

Geofencing in RTLS allows you to create virtual boundaries around physical spaces. These boundaries can trigger alerts and actions when tags enter, exit, or remain within defined areas.

## Creating Geofence Zones

### Basic Zone Creation
1. Open the RTLS Hub interface
2. Navigate to Geofence Configuration
3. Select "Create New Zone"
4. Draw the zone boundary on the floor plan
5. Set zone properties

### Zone Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Inclusion | Alert when entering | Authorized areas |
| Exclusion | Alert when entering | Restricted areas |
| Dwell | Alert after time threshold | Process monitoring |
| Transit | Alert while passing through | Flow monitoring |

## Zone Properties

### Basic Settings
- Zone name
- Zone type
- Active hours
- Priority level
- Associated tags/groups

### Advanced Options
- Entry delay
- Exit delay
- Dwell time thresholds
- Overlap behavior

## Alert Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Configure appropriate alert methods based on your operational requirements and urgency levels.
</Callout>

### Alert Methods
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts
- System dashboard
- API webhooks
- Mobile app push notifications

### Alert Priority Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | Immediate action required | Real-time |
| High | Prompt attention needed | < 5 minutes |
| Medium | Standard monitoring | < 15 minutes |
| Low | Information only | Daily report |

## Best Practices

### Zone Design
1. Avoid complex shapes
2. Account for signal variations
3. Include buffer zones
4. Consider overlapping zones

### Performance Optimization
- Limit active zones per area
- Balance update frequency
- Monitor system load
- Regular zone review

## Integration Options

### API Access
```json
{
  "zone_id": "string",
  "coordinates": [
    {"x": float, "y": float},
    // Additional points
  ],
  "type": "inclusion|exclusion|dwell|transit",
  "rules": {
    "dwell_time": "integer",
    "priority": "string"
  }
}
```

### Webhook Configuration
- Event-based triggers
- Custom payload format
- Authentication options
- Retry policies

For detailed integration steps, refer to our [API Documentation](/api/geofencing).
