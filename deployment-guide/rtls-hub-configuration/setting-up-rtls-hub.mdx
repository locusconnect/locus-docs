1. Ensure that all anchors are connected and online in network.
2. Next, use floor planner tool to create new floor plan designs, draw walls and accurately scale the image
3. First step after adding floor plans is to set a Master Anchor.

4. After selecting the Master(s), go ahead and define the slave anchors and their respective masters.
