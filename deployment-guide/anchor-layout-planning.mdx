## RF Planner Overview

The Locus RF Planner is a powerful tool for planning and optimizing your anchor layout. Available in the Locus portal, it helps you:
- Simulate real-world environments
- Plan anchor placements
- Analyze coverage patterns
- Optimize system performance

## Planning Process

### 1. Initial Setup
- Import floor plans
- Set scale and dimensions
- Define project parameters
- Establish coverage requirements

### 2. Environment Modeling
- Add walls and obstacles
- Define material properties
- Mark restricted areas
- Identify mounting points

### 3. Anchor Placement
- Position virtual anchors
- Set mounting heights
- Define master-slave relationships
- Optimize coverage patterns

## Coverage Analysis

### Signal Quality Indicators
- DOP (Dilution of Precision)
- Expected accuracy zones
- Signal strength heatmap
- Coverage overlap areas

### Performance Metrics
- Number of visible anchors
- Signal path analysis
- Interference prediction
- System reliability estimates

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Maintain line of sight between anchors for optimal performance. Each tag should be visible to at least 4 anchors for reliable positioning.

## Pre-Installation Planning

### Site Survey Integration
- Import site survey data
- Mark existing infrastructure
- Note installation constraints
- Document special requirements

### Optimization Tools
- Coverage optimization
- Anchor count minimization
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Performance prediction

## Best Practices

### Layout Guidelines
1. **Master Anchor Placement**
   - Central location
   - Clear line of sight
   - Optimal height positioning
   - Stable mounting surface

2. **Slave Anchor Distribution**
   - Even spacing
   - Overlapping coverage
   - Strategic positioning
   - Height consistency

3. **Coverage Verification**
   - Run simulation tests
   - Check dead zones
   - Verify accuracy levels
   - Validate requirements

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Use the RF Planner's simulation features to test different layouts before physical installation. This saves time and resources during deployment.
