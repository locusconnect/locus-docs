### Positioning Requirements
| Parameter | Requirement | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Height | 2.5-3m optimal | From floor level |
| Spacing | 5m minimum | Between anchors |
| Line of Sight | Required | For optimal performance |
| Clearance | 30cm radius | From metal objects |

## Installation Procedure

### Wall/Ceiling Mounting
1. **Preparation**
   - Gather required tools
   - Verify mounting location
   - Check wall/ceiling material
   - Locate power source

2. **Bracket Installation**

   - Mark mounting points
   - Drill pilot holes
   - Install anchors
   - Secure bracket

3. **Anchor Mounting**
   - Attach anchor to bracket
   - Secure all fasteners
   - Connect cables
   - Verify orientation

### Pole Mounting
1. **Adapter Setup**
   - Select correct adapter
   - Assemble components
   - Prepare mounting straps

2. **Installation**
   - Position adapter
   - Secure straps
   - Mount anchor
   - Route cables

## Cable Management

### Best Practices
- Use proper cable guides
- Maintain bend radius
- Secure at intervals
- Label all cables

### Cable Requirements
| Type | Specification | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Ethernet | Cat5e or better | For PoE |
| Bend Radius | 25mm minimum | Prevent damage |
| Service Loop | 30cm extra | For maintenance |
| Strain Relief | Required | At connections |

## Orientation Guidelines

### Optimal Positioning
