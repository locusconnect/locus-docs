# Assembly and Mounting

## Mounting Options

Locus RTLS Anchors can be mounted in various ways to suit your installation environment:

* Wall mounting
* Ceiling mounting
* Pole mounting
* Truss mounting

## Mounting Requirements

### Optimal Positioning

* Mount anchors at a height of 2.5-3m above the floor
* Ensure clear line-of-sight between anchors where possible
* Maintain minimum spacing of 5m between anchors
* Avoid mounting near large metal objects or electrical interference sources

### Physical Requirements

* Secure to a stable surface capable of supporting 250g weight
* Allow access to the Ethernet port and status LEDs
* Consider cable management for clean installation

## Installation Procedure

### Wall/Ceiling Mounting

1. Use the mounting bracket as a template to mark drilling points
2. Drill holes and install appropriate anchors for your surface type
3. Secure the mounting bracket with screws
4. Attach the anchor to the mounting bracket
5. Connect the Ethernet cable
6. Verify power and network connectivity via status LEDs

### Pole Mounting

1. Select the appropriate pole mount adapter for your pole diameter
2. Attach the adapter to the mounting bracket
3. Secure the assembly to the pole with the provided straps
4. Attach the anchor to the mounting bracket
5. Connect the Ethernet cable
6. Verify power and network connectivity via status LEDs

## Orientation

* The antenna orientation affects coverage pattern
* For most installations, orient anchors with the logo facing forward
* For specific coverage requirements, consult the detailed installation guide

## Cable Management

* Use cable clips or conduit to secure Ethernet cables
* Maintain minimum bend radius of 1" (25mm) for Ethernet cables
* Allow service loop for future maintenance
* Label cables according to your organization's standards
