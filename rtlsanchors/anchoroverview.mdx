# Locus Anchor Overview

Locus Anchors are the foundational fixed reference points for any Locus Real-Time Location System (RTLS) deployment. They are strategically installed throughout your facility to enable precise and reliable positioning of mobile Locus Tags.

## What is a Locus Anchor?

A Locus Anchor is a stationary device mounted at known positions within your deployment area. Each anchor communicates with mobile tags and other anchors using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology. This technology allows for precise distance measurements (ranging) between devices, achieving centimeter-level accuracy for location calculations.

## Key Features of Locus Anchors

- **High Precision Positioning:** Enables tag location with typical accuracy of 10-30cm.
- **Robust Network Connectivity:** Connects via standard Ethernet (supporting Power over Ethernet - PoE - for applicable models) for reliable data backhaul and easy integration into existing network infrastructure.
- **Simplified Installation (PoE):** For PoE-enabled models, a single Ethernet cable provides both power and data, simplifying installation and reducing cabling costs.
- **Industrial-Grade Design:** Features a robust housing suitable for deployment in various industrial and commercial environments.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to support large-scale deployments with potentially hundreds or thousands of anchors covering extensive areas.
- **Streamlined Configuration:** Offers straightforward web-based setup and management tools for efficient deployment and maintenance.

## How Locus Anchors Work

Locus Anchors operate collaboratively within a network to deliver precise positioning data:

1.  Anchors are installed at fixed, surveyed (known) positions within the operational environment.
2.  Each anchor emits and receives UWB radio signals to and from mobile tags within its range.
3.  By measuring the Time-of-Flight (ToF) of these UWB signals between a tag and multiple anchors, the system calculates precise distances.
4.  The Locus Location Engine processes these distance measurements (and potentially other data like Angle of Arrival, if supported) from multiple anchors to triangulate or multilaterate the tag's coordinates in real-time.

## Typical Network Architecture

Locus Anchors connect to your local network via standard Ethernet and communicate with the central Locus Location Engine server. A typical deployment consists of:

- Multiple Locus Anchors strategically installed throughout the desired coverage area.
- Standard network infrastructure (switches, cabling) connecting anchors to the Locus Location Engine.
- The Locus Location Engine server (hardware or virtual appliance) responsible for position calculations and system management.
- Client applications (e.g., Locus 3D, middleware, custom integrations) for visualizing location data and utilizing system outputs.
