# RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)

## Overview

RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) is a fundamental RF measurement that quantifies received signal power in radio communications. In Locus RTLS systems, RSSI serves as a critical metric for system diagnostics, range estimation, and positioning validation.

## RSSI Fundamentals

    classDef weak fill:#F44336,stroke:#D32F2F,stroke-width:2px,color:white

    A[Transmitter] --> B[-30 to -50 dBm]
    A --> C[-50 to -75 dBm]
    A --> D[-75 to -90 dBm]

    class B strong
    class C medium
    class D weak

```

### Signal Characteristics
| Parameter | Range | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Strong Signal | -30 to -50 dBm | Optimal range | Direct LOS |
| Good Signal | -50 to -65 dBm | Normal operation | Typical indoor |
| Fair Signal | -65 to -75 dBm | Acceptable | Through walls |
| Poor Signal | -75 to -85 dBm | Marginal | Long range |
| Very Poor | Below -85 dBm | Unreliable | Out of range |

   - Heat map generation
   - Weak spot identification
   - Overlap verification

2. **Anchor Placement**
   - Line-of-sight validation
   - Inter-anchor visibility
   - Coverage optimization
   - Interference avoidance

3. **System Validation**
   - Performance verification
   - Range confirmation
   - Link reliability
   - Network health

### Environmental Factors
| Factor | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Distance | -20dB/decade | Anchor density |
| Walls | -3 to -15 dB | Strategic placement |
| Multipath | ±6 dB | Diversity techniques |
| Interference | Variable | Channel selection |
| Orientation | Up to -20 dB | Antenna design |

### Quality Indicators
| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| RSSI | Greater than \-65 dBm | \-65 to \-75 dBm | Less than \-75 dBm |
| Stability | ±3 dB | ±6 dB | Greater than ±6 dB |
| Coverage | Greater than 90% | 70-90% | Less than 70% |
| Reliability | Greater than 99% | 95-99% | Less than 95% |
