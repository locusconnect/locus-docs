    participant T as Tag
    participant A1 as Anchor 1
    participant A2 as Anchor 2
    participant A3 as Anchor 3
    
    Note over T,A3: TDoA Positioning
    T->>A1: UWB Pulse (t1)
    T->>A2: UWB Pulse (t2)
    T->>A3: UWB Pulse (t3)
    
    Note over A1,A3: Time Differences
    A1->>A2: Δt1 = t2-t1
    A2->>A3: Δt2 = t3-t2
    
    Note over T,A3: Position Calculation
```

### Two-Way Ranging (TWR)

    A->>T: Final (t3)
    
    Note over A,T: Distance = c × (t3-t1)/2
```
