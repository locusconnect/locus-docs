This page guides you through the unboxing and assembly of the Locus RTLS Locator Kit components, including Anchors and Tags. For temporary setups like demos or testing, mounting Anchors on tripods is often the most convenient method.

## Anchor Unboxing and Assembly
The RTLS Locator Kit includes **Anchors (4x) and Tripod Adapters (4x)**. Assemble the tripod adapter to the Anchor and then mount the anchor assembly onto a suitable tripod (e.g., a 3m tripod is often used).

Find more details about the assembly in the **Anchor Assembly Guide**.

## Anchor Powering Up

The Locus Anchor Apollo supports powering via Active PoE (IEEE 802.3af/at) or Passive PoE for the Wired version, and via Micro-USB for the Wireless version.

<Callout type="info">
  In simple terms, **Active PoE (IEEE 802.3af/at)** refers to any type of PoE that negotiates the correct voltage between the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE, like a PoE switch) and the Powered Device (PD, like an Anchor). **Passive PoE** does no such negotiation and continuously sends electric current over the Ethernet cable at a specific voltage, regardless of the connected device.

The Locator Kit may include one of two Anchor Apollo versions: Wired or Wireless. Please follow the respective guidelines below for your specific anchor type.

  <Tab title="Anchor Apollo Wired">
    **Overview**: The Anchor Apollo Wired requires a wired Ethernet (PoE) connection to deliver both power and network backhaul simultaneously.
    
    **Cabling**: Use the provided Ethernet (Cat.5e or better) cables to power up all Wired Anchors. Interconnect the Anchors to the PoE switch included in your kit or a compatible one.

    <Callout type="error">
    **Do not connect Micro-USB and PoE at the same time to the Anchor Apollo Wired**. It may damage the Anchor permanently. The Anchor Apollo Wired is designed to be powered only through PoE.
    </Callout>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Anchor Apollo Wireless">
    **Overview**: The Anchor Apollo Wireless is powered via its Micro-USB port, typically using power banks (not included in the kit) for mobile deployments or USB power adapters for fixed setups.
    
    **Cabling**: Connect the Anchor Apollo Wireless to a power bank using a standard Micro-USB cable. You can use zip ties or Velcro tape to fasten the power bank to the tripod if needed.

    <Callout type="error">
    **Do not connect PoE to the Anchor Apollo Wireless**. It may damage the Anchor permanently. The Anchor Apollo Wireless is designed to be powered only through its Micro-USB port.

## Tag Alexander Asset Unboxing & Assembly

Tag Alexander Asset is coin-cell powered. The RTLS Locator kit typically includes two tags and two CR2032 coin batteries. To activate a tag, unscrew the back panel and insert a coin cell, observing correct polarity.

<Callout type="info">
  Remember to check the polarity (+/-) of the coin-cell while inserting it into the Tag Alexander. Incorrect insertion may prevent the tag from working or damage it.

Once all components are assembled and powered, you can proceed with the [RTLS Hub Setup](./RTLSHub).
