# Wired Networking for Locator Kit

This section covers the setup and best practices for wired networking using the RTLS Locator Kit. A wired Ethernet-based network is the recommended architecture for most deployments, offering superior stability and performance, especially for larger demonstrations, Proof of Concepts (PoCs), and production projects.

<Callout type="info">
 **Tip:** Recommended network architecture is an Ethernet-based network, and the network **should be dedicated to RTLS** if possible for optimal performance and simplified troubleshooting.

The RTLS Locator Kit is delivered pre-configured for Ethernet-based wired communication. Therefore, deploying the wired setup is straightforward and typically involves connecting the components as outlined below, with minimal software configuration changes required on the Locus equipment itself.
The kit includes one PoE switch, one wired router, and a set of Ethernet cables (5x).

üëáüèªWired deployment is suggested for larger demos. Our recommendation is to use a wired solution for any project or PoC.

## Wired Network Planning Rules
If you are deploying the RTLS kit via an Ethernet PoE switch, adhere to the following network planning rules:
- **Cable Length:** Ensure Ethernet cables (Cat 5E or better) do not exceed 100 meters (328 feet) between the power source (PoE switch) and the anchors. 
  - For longer distances, a PoE extender can be used.
- **Cable Integrity:** Test all cables after deployment to ensure they provide a reliable data connection and power. Optionally, use a [LAN tester](https://www.amazon.com/Klein-Tools-VDV526-100-Network-Explorer/dp/B07RT1J9MB) to verify cabling integrity.
- **Network Segmentation:** If possible, anchors should have **a dedicated VLAN** or be on an **isolated physical network segment** connected to the RTLS Hub.
- **Switch Configuration:** Ensure that no restrictive Access Control Lists (ACLs) are active on the switches within the network segment used by the RTLS components, or that they are properly configured to allow necessary traffic.
- **Subnets:** The anchors and the RTLS Hub server software can be located on different subnets, provided routing is correctly configured between them.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Make sure any firewalls are properly configured and all necessary communication [ports are allowed](../ProjectExecution/NetworkLayout/NetworkArchitectureAndPorts) for Locus RTLS traffic.

<Callout type="info">
 The default IP address range of the Locator Kit Wired components (like the pre-configured router and anchors if set to DHCP by default within this range) is typically **192.168.88.0/24**.

Properly planning and implementing your wired network is key to a successful Locus RTLS deployment.
