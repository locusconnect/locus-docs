Proper maintenance and care of your RTLS Locator Kit components will ensure their longevity and optimal performance. This section provides general guidelines for Anchors and Tags.

## General Care Instructions

- **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Do not expose components to temperatures outside their specified operating range.
- **Protect from Liquids:** Keep all electronic components away from water and other liquids to prevent damage.
- **Handle with Care:** Avoid dropping or subjecting the components to strong physical shocks.
- **Cleaning:** Use a dry or slightly damp cloth to clean the exterior of anchors and tags. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.

## Anchor Maintenance

- **Physical Inspection:** Regularly inspect anchors for any physical damage, loose connections, or signs of wear on cables and mounts.
- **Mounting Checks:** Ensure anchors are securely mounted and that tripods or other mounting hardware are stable.
- **Cable Management:** Keep PoE and power cables neatly organized and protected from potential damage or snags.
- **Firmware Updates:** Periodically check the [Locus Portal](https://portal.locusconnect.com) for any firmware updates for your Anchors and follow the provided update instructions if necessary.

## Tag Maintenance

- **Battery Replacement:** For battery-powered tags like the Tag Alexander, replace the coin cell battery (e.g., CR2032) when it is depleted. Follow the [Tag Assembly Guide](./LocatorKitAssembly#tag-alexander-asset-unboxing--assembly) for instructions on opening the tag and replacing the battery. Pay attention to battery polarity.
- **Physical Condition:** Check tags for any cracks, damage, or wear that might affect their performance or attachment to assets/personnel.
- **Cleaning:** Tags worn by personnel should be cleaned regularly according to hygiene best practices, using appropriate disinfectants if necessary, ensuring they are safe for electronic devices.

## Storage

- When not in use for extended periods, store the Locator Kit components in a cool, dry place, preferably in their original packaging or a protective case.
- Remove batteries from tags if they will be stored for very long periods to prevent potential leakage.
