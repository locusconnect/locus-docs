# Maintenance and Care for RTLS Locator Kit Components

Proper maintenance and care of your RTLS Locator Kit components will ensure their longevity and optimal performance. This section provides general guidelines for Anchors and Tags.

## General Care Instructions

- **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Do not expose components to temperatures outside their specified operating range.
- **Protect from Liquids:** Keep all electronic components away from water and other liquids to prevent damage.
- **Handle with Care:** Avoid dropping or subjecting the components to strong physical shocks.
- **Cleaning:** Use a dry or slightly damp cloth to clean the exterior of anchors and tags. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.

## Anchor Maintenance

- **Physical Inspection:** Regularly inspect anchors for any physical damage, loose connections, or signs of wear on cables and mounts.
- **Mounting Checks:** Ensure anchors are securely mounted and that tripods or other mounting hardware are stable.
- **Cable Management:** Keep PoE and power cables neatly organized and protected from potential damage or snags.
- **Firmware Updates:** Periodically check the [Locus Portal](https://portal.locusconnect.com) for any firmware updates for your Anchors and follow the provided update instructions if necessary.

## Tag Maintenance

- **Battery Replacement:** For battery-powered tags like the Tag Alexander, replace the coin cell battery (e.g., CR2032) when it is depleted. Follow the [Tag Assembly Guide](./LocatorKitAssembly#tag-alexander-asset-unboxing--assembly) for instructions on opening the tag and replacing the battery. Pay attention to battery polarity.
- **Physical Condition:** Check tags for any cracks, damage, or wear that might affect their performance or attachment to assets/personnel.
- **Cleaning:** Tags worn by personnel should be cleaned regularly according to hygiene best practices, using appropriate disinfectants if necessary, ensuring they are safe for electronic devices.

## Storage

- When not in use for extended periods, store the Locator Kit components in a cool, dry place, preferably in their original packaging or a protective case.
- Remove batteries from tags if they will be stored for very long periods to prevent potential leakage.
