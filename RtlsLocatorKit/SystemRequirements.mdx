# System Requirements for RTLS Locator Kit

Meeting the specified system requirements is crucial for a successful and performant deployment of the RTLS Locator Kit. This page outlines the necessary hardware and software prerequisites for both the client computer/server running the RTLS Hub and the RTLS components themselves.

## Component Requirements

### Computer & Peripherals (for RTLS Hub)
- ✅ **Processor:** x64 architecture with VTx (Virtualization Technology) enabled in BIOS/UEFI.
- ✅ **Network:** Ethernet port available for wired anchor communication (if applicable) and initial router setup.
- ✅ **Wireless:** Wi-Fi card for wireless anchor communication (if applicable).
- ✅ **GPU:** Basic internal or discrete GPU (Recommended if you plan to use the Locus 3D Software for visualization).

### Software (for RTLS Hub)
- ✅ **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox (latest stable version recommended).
- ✅ **Web Browser:** Google Chrome (latest stable version recommended, as some Locus 3D Software features may have limited compatibility with other browsers).

### RTLS Hardware (Locator Kit Contents)
- ✅ Locus Tags
- ✅ Locus Anchor Apollo (Wired/Wireless)
- ✅ Power Supplies (e.g., Power Bank or 5V USB Adapters for wireless anchors/router)

### Other Recommended Equipment
- ✅ Tripods or suitable mounting hardware for optimal anchor placement.

## RTLS Hub Server Specifications

The server or laptop where you deploy the RTLS Hub software (typically running within VirtualBox) requires a sufficiently powerful CPU. A strong single-thread performance is important, but an adequate number of cores/threads is also necessary as the RTLS Hub is a multi-core application.

An example of a server suitable for a typical RTLS Locator Kit deployment is detailed below. Use CPU benchmark websites like [www.cpubenchmark.net](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/) to compare your existing or planned hardware against these recommendations.

| Installation Size                  | CPU Type             | CPU Spec. (Cores/Threads) | CPU Single Thread Rating | CPU Mark | Recommended RAM (for VM) |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| < 10 Anchors & < 10 Tags @ 0.5s RR | Intel Celeron G1610T | 2/2                       | 1241                     | 1341     | 4 GB                     |

For more detailed server specifications, especially for larger deployments beyond the scope of a single Locator Kit, please see the page [Server System Specification](../ProjectExecution/NetworkLayout/ServerSystemSpecification).

Ensuring your hardware meets these guidelines will help guarantee a smooth and reliable RTLS experience.
