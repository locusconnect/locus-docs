# Live Demonstration Guide for RTLS Locator Kit

Congratulations! Your RTLS Locator Kit should now be successfully set up and running. This guide provides suggestions on what to showcase during a live demonstration to effectively convey the capabilities of the Locus RTLS.

## Key Demonstration Points:

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Showcase the live tracking of tags on the Locus [RTLS Hub Software](../RTLS_Hub/Documentation/RtlsHubOverview) interface or Locus 3D map. Emphasize the accuracy and low latency.
- **Zone Creation & Alerts (if applicable):** If you have set up zones, demonstrate how alerts are triggered when a tag enters or exits a defined area.
- **Tag Diversity:** If you have different tag types, briefly explain their use cases (e.g., asset tags, personnel badges).
- **Ease of Use:** Highlight the user-friendliness of the software interface for monitoring and basic configuration.
- **Scalability Discussion:** Briefly mention the system's capability to scale from a small Locator Kit deployment to a large enterprise-wide solution.

## Tips for a Successful Demonstration:

- **Prepare Your Demo Area:** Ensure you have a clear area for the demonstration, with anchors placed according to the [deployment rules](./AnchorDeploymentRules) for optimal performance.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Before the demonstration, test all components and software features you plan to show.
- **Keep it Concise:** Focus on the most impactful features relevant to your audience.
- **Anticipate Questions:** Be prepared to answer common questions about accuracy, range, battery life, and integration possibilities.
