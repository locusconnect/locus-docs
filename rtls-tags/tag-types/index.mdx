Locus Tags are compact, energy-efficient devices that enable real-time tracking of assets and personnel in your facility. They form the mobile component of the Locus RTLS ecosystem.

## What is a Locus Tag?

A tag is a small, battery-powered device that can be attached to assets, vehicles, or worn by personnel. Tags communicate with the fixed anchor infrastructure using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology, enabling their positions to be determined with high accuracy.
