## Overview

The Locus RTLS system uses a layered architecture to provide real-time location tracking with high accuracy and reliability. This page explains the main components and how they work together.

## System Components

### Hardware Layer

The hardware layer consists of the physical devices that enable position tracking:

* **Anchors** - Fixed reference points mounted throughout the facility
* **Tags** - Mobile devices attached to assets or carried by personnel
* **Network Infrastructure** - Ethernet switches and cabling connecting anchors
* **Location Engine** - Edge computing device that processes location data

### Middleware Layer

The middleware layer processes the raw radio data and transforms it into usable position information:

* **Positioning Engine** - Algorithms for calculating tag positions
* **System Management** - Configuration and monitoring services
* **Data Processing** - Filtering and smoothing of position data
* **Time Synchronization** - Precise timing coordination across anchors

### Application Layer

The application layer provides interfaces for users and integration with other systems:

* **Locus 3D Software** - Visualization and configuration interface
* **API Services** - Integration points for external applications
* **Analytics Tools** - Historical data analysis and reporting
* **Alerting System** - Real-time notifications based on position data

## Data Flow

The RTLS system's data flow follows these steps:

1. Tags transmit UWB radio signals at configured intervals
2. Multiple anchors receive these signals and record precise timestamps
3. Anchors forward the timing data to the Location Engine
4. The Location Engine calculates positions using multilateration algorithms
5. Position data is stored, processed, and made available to applications
6. Applications present the data to users or trigger automated actions

## Scalability

The Locus RTLS architecture is designed to scale according to deployment needs:

### Horizontal Scalability

* Support for thousands of tags per system
* Multiple Location Engines can operate in parallel
* Segmented areas can function independently or as part of a unified system

### Vertical Scalability

* Location Engines with different processing capabilities
* Support for simple presence detection to high-precision positioning
* Flexible update rates from 0.1Hz to 10Hz

## Deployment Models

### On-Premises Deployment

* All components hosted within the customer's facility
* Data remains within the local network
* Minimal internet connectivity requirements

### Hybrid Deployment

* Location Engine and anchors on premises
* Management and visualization in the cloud
* Real-time data stays local, configuration and analytics in the cloud

### Cloud-Connected Deployment

* All components on premises
* Secure connection to Locus cloud services
* Remote monitoring, management, and updates

## System Requirements

* **Network**: Gigabit Ethernet, preferably with PoE
* **Power**: IEEE 802.3af PoE for anchors, standard power for Location Engine
* **Server**: Minimum specifications depend on deployment size
* **Storage**: 100GB+ recommended for historical data retention
* **Bandwidth**: Minimum 1Mbps per 20 anchors

## Security Features

* End-to-end encryption of position data
* Role-based access control
* Secure boot and firmware validation
* Network isolation options
* Audit logging and monitoring
