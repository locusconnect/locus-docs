## UWB Channel Overview

Ultra-Wideband technology operates across multiple frequency channels, each with different characteristics. Locus RTLS supports the following UWB channels defined in the IEEE 802.15.4z standard:

| Channel | Center Frequency | Bandwidth | Typical Use Case |
|---------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Channel 1 | 3494.4 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Standard indoor positioning |
| Channel 2 | 3993.6 MHz | 499.2 MHz | High-performance indoor |
| Channel 3 | 4492.8 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Specialized applications |
| Channel 5 | 6489.6 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Global compatibility |
| Channel 7 | 7987.2 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Low interference environments |

## Channel Selection Factors

When selecting a UWB channel for your deployment, consider the following factors:

### Regulatory Compliance

* Different regions have different frequency regulations
* Channel 5 has the broadest global acceptance
* Channels 1-3 may have regional restrictions

### Environmental Factors

* Signal propagation characteristics vary by frequency
* Lower frequency channels offer better penetration through walls
* Higher frequency channels may provide better precision

### Interference Sources

* Existing wireless systems in the deployment area
* Industrial equipment operating in similar frequencies
* Other UWB systems in proximity
