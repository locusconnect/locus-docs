# First Path Power

## Overview

First Path Power is a critical RF performance parameter in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning systems. It measures the power of the first signal component that arrives at a receiver, which typically represents the direct line-of-sight path between transmitter and receiver.

## Importance in RTLS

In Locus RTLS, First Path Power measurements provide valuable information for:

* Accurate distance estimation
* Line-of-sight verification
* Signal quality assessment
* Multipath environment characterization

## First Path Detection

### How It Works

UWB systems can distinguish between the direct path signal and reflections (multipath) due to:

1. The extremely short duration of UWB pulses (nanoseconds)
2. High time resolution of receivers
3. Advanced signal processing algorithms

### First Path vs. Strongest Path

* **First Path** - The first signal component to arrive, typically the direct path
* **Strongest Path** - The signal component with the highest power, which may be a reflection

In ideal conditions, the first path and strongest path are identical. In complex environments with reflections, they may differ significantly.

## First Path Power Metrics

Locus RTLS uses several metrics related to First Path Power:

### First Path Power Level (FP-Power)

* Measured in dBm
* Indicates the absolute power of the first arriving signal component
* Typical values range from -80 dBm to -105 dBm

### First Path to Total Power Ratio (FP-Ratio)

* Expressed as a percentage (0-100%)
* Indicates what portion of the total received signal power is in the first path
* Higher values indicate clearer line-of-sight conditions

## Using First Path Data

### Link Quality Assessment

| FP-Power | FP-Ratio | Link Quality | Reliability |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| High | High | Excellent | Very reliable |
| High | Low | Good with multipath | Reliable with processing |
| Low | High | Weak but clear | Moderately reliable |
| Low | Low | Poor with multipath | Unreliable |

### Installation Optimization

First Path metrics are valuable during system installation:

* Verify direct line-of-sight between anchors
* Identify areas with significant multipath issues
* Optimize anchor placement for reliable ranging
* Validate RF planning assumptions

## Factors Affecting First Path Power

Several factors can influence First Path Power measurements:

* **Distance** - Power decreases with increasing distance
* **Obstacles** - Physical barriers attenuate the direct path
* **Antenna orientation** - Affects signal radiation pattern
* **Environmental reflectors** - Metal surfaces, walls, equipment
* **Interference** - Other RF systems or electrical noise

## Viewing and Using First Path Data

### In the Locus RTLS Hub

First Path data is accessible in the Locus RTLS Hub:

1. Navigate to System Diagnostics > RF Parameters
2. Select the "First Path Analysis" view
3. Choose anchor pairs or tag-anchor combinations
4. View real-time or historical First Path metrics

### For Troubleshooting

First Path metrics help identify specific issues:

* Low FP-Power with high FP-Ratio: Check for distance or obstruction issues
* High FP-Power with low FP-Ratio: Investigate multipath or reflection sources
* Inconsistent readings: Look for intermittent interference
* Asymmetric readings between devices: Check antenna alignment
