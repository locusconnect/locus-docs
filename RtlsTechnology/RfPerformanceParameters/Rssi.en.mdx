## Overview

RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. In the Locus RTLS system, RSSI values are used for diagnostics, range estimation, and as supplementary data for position calculations.

## Understanding RSSI Values

RSSI in Locus RTLS is measured in decibels relative to one milliwatt (dBm):

* Typical values range from -30 dBm (very strong) to -90 dBm (very weak)
* Higher (less negative) values indicate stronger signals
* Lower (more negative) values indicate weaker signals

## RSSI Applications in RTLS

### Signal Quality Assessment

RSSI provides a quick indication of radio link quality between tags and anchors:

| RSSI Range | Signal Quality | Reliability |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| -30 to -50 dBm | Excellent | Very high |
| -50 to -65 dBm | Good | High |
| -65 to -75 dBm | Fair | Moderate |
| -75 to -85 dBm | Poor | Low |
| Below -85 dBm | Very poor | Very low |

### Installation Optimization

During system installation, RSSI measurements help optimize anchor placement:

* Identify areas with weak signal coverage
* Verify line-of-sight between anchors
* Detect potential interference sources
* Confirm successful RF planning implementation

### Supplementary Positioning Data

While RSSI alone is not precise enough for high-accuracy positioning, it serves as:

* A validation check for TDoA and TWR measurements
* A rough proximity indicator when precise positioning is unavailable
* A fallback mechanism in challenging environments

## Factors Affecting RSSI

RSSI values can be influenced by various factors:

* **Distance** - Signal strength typically decreases with distance
* **Obstacles** - Walls, furniture, and people can attenuate signals
* **Interference** - Other radio systems operating in similar frequencies
* **Multipath** - Signal reflections causing constructive or destructive interference
* **Antenna orientation** - Relative orientation of tag and anchor antennas

## RSSI in the Locus Software

### Viewing RSSI Data

RSSI information is available in the Locus RTLS Hub:

1. Navigate to System Diagnostics > RF Performance
2. Select the anchor or tag of interest
3. View real-time or historical RSSI values
4. Export data for further analysis if needed

### Using RSSI for Troubleshooting

Common issues that can be diagnosed with RSSI data:

* Sudden drops in RSSI may indicate new obstacles
* Consistently low RSSI suggests anchor relocation may be needed
* Fluctuating RSSI might indicate interference issues
* Asymmetric RSSI between devices can reveal antenna problems

## Best Practices

* Use RSSI as one of several metrics for system health, not in isolation
* Establish baseline RSSI values after initial installation
* Regularly monitor for significant changes from baseline
* Consider environmental factors when interpreting RSSI data
