# Server Specification
The complete Locus RTLS system is overseen by the RTLS Hub application. The RTLS Hub also enables integration with other systems to work alongside the Locus RTLS system and develop applications based on the provided data.

Sufficient server performance is necessary to ensure that the RTLS operates smoothly.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The necessary computing power will vary depending on the **number of tags, their update frequency, and the number of anchors** in use. Hence, it is crucial to select a server configuration that can guarantee sufficient computing power.

To ensure sufficient computing power for the RTLS system, it is important to select a server configuration with a strong CPU. This should include both a high single thread rating and adequate multi-threading capabilities, as RTLS Studio is a multi-core application.

Below is a chart containing information regarding the recommended CPU model and its benchmark rating for different installation sizes:

 |Installation Size|CPU Type|CPU Spec.|CPU Single Thread Ratings|CPU Ratings|Recommended RAM Size|
|----|----|---|---|---|---|
