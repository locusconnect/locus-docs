## Troubleshooting Issue - Virtualization is disabled.

It may happen that the virtualization is disabled in the host machine.

1. If that is the case, you need to enable virtualization in BIOS. To do so, go to Search and type “Advanced startup” and select the first option. Then click “Restart now”. This will restart your computer.

4. Select the “UEFI Firmware Settings” here.

This will guide you to BIOS. Here you need to find the “Virtualization VT-x” option and select “enable”. On most computers, this can be found under “Advanced” or “Security” tabs but this option differs depending on your computer. After you have enabled virtualization, save the settings and exit BIOS. Then launch VirtualBox again and the image should load without any errors.
