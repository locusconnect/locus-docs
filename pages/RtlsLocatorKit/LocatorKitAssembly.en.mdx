## Anchor Powering Up

The Locus Anchor supports powering via Active or Passive PoE

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In simple terms, **Active PoE(IEEE 802.3af/at)** refers to any type of PoE that negotiates the correct voltage between the switch and the PoE-powered device. **Passive PoE** does no such negotiation, and as such is always sending electric current out over the ethernet cable at a certain voltage regardless of the device it's going to.

Based on your purchase of Locator Kit there maybe two types of Anchor Version. Please follow respective guidelines for different types of Anchor Apollo.
