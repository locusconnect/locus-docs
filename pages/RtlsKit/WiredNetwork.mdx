# Wired Networking

<Callout emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è" type="info">
 **Tip:** Recommended network architecture is an Ethernet-based network and the network **should be dedicated to RTLS** if possible.
</Callout>

RTLS Locator Kit is delivered pre-configured for Ethernet based wired communication. Therefore, wired deployment requires a few configuration changes. It includes one PoE switch, one wired router and set of cables (5x). 

üëáüèªWired deployment is suggested for larger demos. Our recommendation to use wired solution for a project or PoC.

## Wired Network Planning Rules
If you are considering deploying the RTLS kit via an Ethernet PoE switch follow the following networking planning rules:
- **The cables should not exceed a 100 m length** (cable. category: Cat 5E) between the power source and the anchors. 
  - For longer distances PoE extender can be used.
- All the cables are tested after deployment - cables provide a reliable data connection and power. Optionally you can use [LAN tester](https://www.amazon.com/Klein-Tools-VDV526-100-Network-Explorer/dp/B07RT1J9MB) to verify the cabling.
- The anchors should have **a dedicated VLAN** or **isolated network to RTLS Hub** if possible.
- Make sure that no or properly configured access lists (ACLs) are active on the switches within the network.
- The anchors and the RTLS Hub server software can be located on the different subnets.
- Make sure the firewall is properly configured and all necessary communication [ports are allowed](../ProjectExecution/NetworkLayout/NetworkArchitectureAndPorts).
