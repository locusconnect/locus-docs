## System Specifications

The server or laptop where you deploy RTLS Hub should have a powerful enough CPU. It is very important to have a **powerful enough CPU** on the server. You should have a strong single-thread rating but also enough threads because RTLS Studio is a multicore application. 

An example of a server suitable for RTLS Kit deployment:
