# UWB Technology

Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is the radio technology at the heart of the Locus RTLS system. This page explains the fundamentals of UWB and why it's ideal for high-precision indoor positioning.

## What is Ultra-Wideband?

Ultra-Wideband is a radio technology that operates by transmitting very short pulses of radio energy across a wide spectrum of frequencies. Unlike conventional narrowband systems, UWB:

- Transmits across a wide frequency range (typically >500 MHz)
- Uses extremely short pulse durations (nanoseconds)
- Operates at very low power spectral density

## Key Advantages for RTLS

UWB offers several critical advantages that make it superior for indoor positioning:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| High bandwidth | Exceptional timing resolution |
| Time-of-flight measurement | Direct distance calculation with cm accuracy |
| Low power spectral density | Minimal interference with other systems |
| Short pulse duration | Excellent multipath immunity |
| Low energy consumption | Long battery life for mobile tags |

## Positioning Principles

The Locus RTLS system uses UWB for position determination through these methods:

### Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)

TDoA measures the time difference of signal arrival at multiple anchors:

1. Tags transmit UWB pulses that are received by multiple anchors
2. Anchors record precise reception timestamps
3. The system calculates hyperbolic curves of possible positions
4. The intersection of these curves determines the tag's position

### Two-Way Ranging (TWR)

In some configurations, the system may use TWR:

1. An anchor sends a signal to a tag
2. The tag responds after a precisely known delay
3. The anchor measures total round-trip time
4. Distance is calculated using the speed of light

## Comparison to Other Technologies

| Technology | Accuracy | Range | Power Usage | Multipath Resistance | Infrastructure Cost |
|------------|----------|-------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| UWB | 10-30cm | 50-100m | Medium | Excellent | Higher |
| Bluetooth | 1-3m | 10-30m | Low | Poor | Low |
| WiFi | 3-15m | 50-100m | High | Poor | Medium |
| RFID | Proximity | 1-10m | Very Low | Poor | Medium |

## IEEE Standards

Locus RTLS implementations comply with IEEE 802.15.4z, which standardizes UWB communications for positioning applications. This ensures compatibility, reliability, and performance across deployments.
