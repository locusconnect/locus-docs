# UWB Channels and Profiles

## UWB Channel Overview

Ultra-Wideband technology operates across multiple frequency channels, each with different characteristics. Locus RTLS supports the following UWB channels defined in the IEEE 802.15.4z standard:

| Channel | Center Frequency | Bandwidth | Typical Use Case |
|---------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Channel 1 | 3494.4 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Standard indoor positioning |
| Channel 2 | 3993.6 MHz | 499.2 MHz | High-performance indoor |
| Channel 3 | 4492.8 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Specialized applications |
| Channel 5 | 6489.6 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Global compatibility |
| Channel 7 | 7987.2 MHz | 499.2 MHz | Low interference environments |

## Channel Selection Factors

When selecting a UWB channel for your deployment, consider the following factors:

### Regulatory Compliance

* Different regions have different frequency regulations
* Channel 5 has the broadest global acceptance
* Channels 1-3 may have regional restrictions

### Environmental Factors

* Signal propagation characteristics vary by frequency
* Lower frequency channels offer better penetration through walls
* Higher frequency channels may provide better precision

### Interference Sources

* Existing wireless systems in the deployment area
* Industrial equipment operating in similar frequencies
* Other UWB systems in proximity

## UWB Profiles

Locus RTLS supports multiple UWB operational profiles that define parameters like pulse repetition frequency, preamble length, and data rate.

### Standard Profiles

| Profile | Description | Typical Range | Advantages |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| SP0 | Standard precision | 50-75m | Good balance of range and accuracy |
| HP0 | High precision | 30-50m | Better position accuracy |
| LP0 | Long range | 75-100m | Maximum coverage area |
| EP0 | Energy efficient | 40-60m | Extended tag battery life |

### Custom Profiles

Locus RTLS also supports custom UWB profiles for specialized applications:

* **High Density** - Optimized for environments with many tags
* **High Update Rate** - Maximizes position update frequency
* **Industrial** - Enhanced reliability in challenging RF environments
* **Outdoor** - Modified parameters for outdoor deployments

## Channel and Profile Configuration

### System-Wide Settings

The default channel and profile are set at the system level in the Locus Location Engine:

1. Access the Locus Location Engine configuration interface
2. Navigate to System Settings > Radio Configuration
3. Select the appropriate channel and profile
4. Apply changes and restart the system

### Zone-Based Settings

Different zones can operate on different channels to optimize performance:

1. Define zones in the Locus 3D Software
2. Assign specific channel and profile settings to each zone
3. Anchors will automatically switch parameters based on their assigned zone

## Troubleshooting

Common issues related to channel and profile settings:

* Reduced range or accuracy
* Interference from other systems
* Regulatory compliance warnings
* Inconsistent performance across deployment zones
