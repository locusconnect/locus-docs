# Power Supply

## Overview

The Locus RTLS Anchors are designed to operate with Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology, simplifying deployment by eliminating the need for separate power cables.

## Supported Power Methods

### Power over Ethernet (PoE)

* Compliant with IEEE 802.3af standard
* 48V DC power delivery over standard Ethernet cabling
* Class 2 power device (3.84W - 6.49W power consumption)

### Alternative Power Options

* DC power input (optional adapter required)
* Voltage range: 12-24V DC
* Power consumption: 4W typical, 6W maximum

## Power Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Input voltage | 37-57V DC (PoE) |
| Typical power consumption | 4W |
| Maximum power consumption | 6W |
| Inrush current | 350mA |
