# Anchor Overview

Locus Anchors are the foundation of any RTLS (Real-Time Location System) deployment. They serve as the fixed reference points that enable precise positioning of mobile tags throughout your facility.

## What is a Locus Anchor?

An anchor is a stationary device that is mounted at known positions within your deployment area. Each anchor communicates with mobile tags and other anchors using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology, enabling precise distance measurements with centimeter-level accuracy.

## Key Features

- **High Precision:** Enables positioning with 10-30cm accuracy 
- **Network Connectivity:** Connects via standard Ethernet for easy integration
- **Power over Ethernet:** Simplifies installation with single-cable connection
- **Industrial Design:** Robust housing suitable for various environments
- **Scalable:** Supports large deployments with hundreds of anchors
- **Easy Configuration:** Simple web-based setup and management

## How Anchors Work

Locus Anchors work together in a network to enable precise positioning:

1. Anchors are installed at fixed, known positions in your environment
2. Each anchor communicates with mobile tags using UWB radio signals
3. Time-of-flight measurements between tags and multiple anchors determine precise positions
4. The Locus Location Engine processes these measurements to calculate tag coordinates in real-time

## Network Architecture

Anchors connect to the network via standard Ethernet and communicate with the Locus Location Engine. A typical deployment consists of:

- Multiple anchors installed throughout the coverage area
- Network infrastructure connecting anchors to the location engine
- The Locus Location Engine server for position calculation
- Client applications for visualization and data access
