# Smart Sleep Modes

Locus RTLS tags feature advanced power management capabilities through Smart Sleep Modes. These intelligent power-saving features significantly extend battery life while maintaining positioning functionality when needed.

## Understanding Sleep Modes

Smart Sleep Modes automatically adjust tag behavior based on environmental conditions and configuration settings, optimizing power consumption without manual intervention.

## Available Sleep Modes

| Mode | Description | Power Savings | Position Updates | Wake Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Active | Full operation | None | Regular intervals | N/A |
| Light Sleep | Reduced update rate | 40-60% | Reduced frequency | Motion or scheduled |
| Deep Sleep | Minimal operation | 80-95% | On wake events only | Motion, scheduled, or proximity |
| Hibernation | Ultra-low power | 99% | None until wake | Strong motion or external trigger |

## Motion-Based Activation

Tags equipped with accelerometers can automatically adjust their behavior based on movement:

- When motion is detected, the tag increases its update rate for accurate tracking
- When stationary for a defined period, the tag enters a power-saving mode
- Sensitivity thresholds can be configured to match specific use cases

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "motionActivation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sensitivityThreshold": 0.2,
    "activeModeUpdateRate": 1.0,
    "sleepModeUpdateRate": 0.1,
    "sleepDelay": 300
  }
}
```

## Zone-Based Behavior

Tags can be configured to change their sleep behavior based on location zones:

- High-interest zones: Increased update rate
- Standard zones: Normal update rate
- Low-interest zones: Reduced update rate or deep sleep

This allows for strategic power management across your facility.

## Time-Based Scheduling

Sleep modes can follow predefined schedules:

- Work hours: Normal operation
- After hours: Deep sleep mode
- Weekends: Hibernation

Example schedule configuration:

```json
{
  "schedules": [
    {
      "days": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
      "timeRanges": [
        {
          "start": "08:00",
          "end": "18:00",
          "mode": "active",
          "updateRate": 1.0
        },
        {
          "start": "18:00",
          "end": "08:00",
          "mode": "deepSleep",
          "updateRate": 0.1
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "days": ["saturday", "sunday"],
      "timeRanges": [
        {
          "start": "00:00",
          "end": "23:59",
          "mode": "hibernation"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Battery Life Impact

The following table shows typical battery life improvements with Smart Sleep Modes:

| Usage Scenario | Without Sleep Modes | With Sleep Modes | Improvement |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 24/7 active asset | 6 months | 18 months | 3x |
| 8-hour shift, weekdays | 12 months | 36 months | 3x |
| Occasional use | 18 months | 48+ months | 2.5x+ |

## Configuration

Sleep mode settings can be configured through:

1. Locus RTLS Hub interface
2. Locus Configuration API
3. Tag profile settings

## Best Practices

- Analyze movement patterns before configuring motion sensitivity
- Test wake-up sensitivity in real-world conditions
- Balance power savings with application requirements
- Consider environmental factors that might trigger false motion detection
