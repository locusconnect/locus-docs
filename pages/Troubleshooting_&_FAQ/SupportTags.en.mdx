# Tag Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues with Locus RTLS tags and how to resolve them.

## Common Issues

### Tag Not Visible in System
If a tag is not appearing in your RTLS system:

1. Check if the tag battery is charged
2. Verify the tag is within range of at least three anchors
3. Confirm the tag is registered in the system
4. Ensure the tag firmware is compatible with your system version

### Poor Tag Positioning Accuracy
If tag position data is inaccurate:

1. Check for environmental interference
2. Verify that enough anchors can see the tag (minimum 3, recommended 4+)
3. Check if the tag and anchors have clear line of sight
4. Verify antenna orientation on both tags and anchors

### Battery Issues
If you experience shorter than expected battery life:

1. Reduce update frequency if high precision isn't required
2. Check for firmware updates that may improve battery performance
3. Verify the tag isn't in a location causing constant mode switches
