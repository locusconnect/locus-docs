title: Anchor (Wired) Installation Rules
---

To achieve the best possible positioning performance, please carefully review this section and ensure that the following points are taken into consideration during the deployment process

The Anchor Apollo (Wired) features an omnidirectional antenna that must be installed in a vertical orientation, either upright or upside-down in some cases. The ideal radiation pattern of the antenna can be seen in the image below. For optimal performance, it is crucial to properly install the anchor and avoid bending the antenna.

  To ensure accurate positioning, at least **four** anchors are required for position calculation. <br />
  This minimum number of anchors is necessary to create a properly-shaped location cell and obtain precise location information.

<Callout type="info" emoji="✅">
  For optimal results, it's recommended to mount the anchors at the **same height** within each location cell. <br /><br />
  If this isn't feasible due to venue restrictions, try to keep them within roughly the same level, with a maximum difference of 100 cm. Keep in mind that for Anchor Apollo Wired, the absolute height should not exceed 6 meters above the tags.

  **It is important to keep the anchors separated from the walls or ceiling** <br /> Use the holders provided with the anchors to mount them, and avoid placing them directly on the wall or ceiling. This could affect the anchor's antenna radiation pattern and reduce its performance. If an anchor must be installed close to the ceiling, mount it with the antenna pointing vertically down as shown in the picture above

### Correct installation examples
 As shown in the image below, the antenna should be installed pointing vertically upwards. However, if the anchor is installed near the ceiling, the antenna should be pointed downwards instead.
