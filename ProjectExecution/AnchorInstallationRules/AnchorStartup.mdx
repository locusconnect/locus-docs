## Powering Wired Anchor

The wired anchors are powered by a network switch supporting **PoE IEEE 802.3af** standard via a Cat 5e UTP cable.

Once the anchor is connected to a stable power supply, a blue LED blinks several times, indicating that the anchor is powered ON.

  **Do not connect PoE and Micro-USB together at the same time <br />**
  Connecting both PoE and Micro-USB together may damage the wired Anchor permanently and render it unusable.
</Callout>

We recommend to have a dedicated network (isolated) for RTLS or a separate VLAN for anchor network for best possible experience.
