# Networking Prerequisites

	- Ensure minimum Cat 5e PoE cables
	- The RTLS network should be isolated either via dedicated deloyment or VLAN to improve security
	- Consider installing a remote access ability to RTLS server to get full support from Locus team.
	
## Key guidelines for RTLS Networking

	- **The length of the cables between the power source and anchors should not exceed 100m** (minimum category: Cat 5E). PoE extenders can be used for longer distances. 
	- After deployment, all cables must be tested to ensure reliable data connection and power supply.
	- Ideally, anchors should be on a **dedicated VLAN or isolated network to RTLS Hub** if possible.
	- Ensure that any access lists (ACLs) on switches within the network are either disabled or properly configured 
	- Properly configure the firewall and **allow all necessary communication ports**
